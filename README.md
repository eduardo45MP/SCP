# Project Proposal: Simple Classifier with Python

## Project Title: Email Spam Classifier

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to implement a simple classifier using Python and popular machine learning libraries, such as scikit-learn. The focus will be on developing an email spam classifier, utilizing machine learning techniques to differentiate between spam and non-spam emails.

### Objectives

1. **Implementing a Basic Classifier:**
   - Utilize Python programming language and scikit-learn library to create a simple email classifier.
   - Explore various machine learning algorithms available in scikit-learn for classification tasks.

2. **Dataset Selection:**
   - Acquire a suitable dataset for training and testing the classifier.
   - Ensure the dataset contains a diverse set of emails, including both spam and non-spam examples.

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Clean and preprocess the dataset to prepare it for training.
   - Feature extraction: Convert emails into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms.

4. **Model Training:**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train the classifier using different machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or Decision Trees.

5. **Evaluation and Metrics:**
   - Evaluate the performance of the classifier using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
   - Compare the performance of different algorithms to identify the most effective approach.

6. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - Develop a simple user interface to allow users to input an email and receive a classification result.
   - Enhance user experience by providing clear indications of the classification outcome.
